# [Recruit Restaurant Visitor Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/c/recruit-restaurant-visitor-forecasting)

## Problem Statement 
Running a thriving local restaurant isn't always as charming as first impressions appear. There are often all sorts of unexpected troubles popping up that could hurt business.

One common predicament is that restaurants need to know how many customers to expect each day to effectively purchase ingredients and schedule staff members. The daily number of customers affects all sorts of business decisions, including the quantity of perishable ingredients to purchase as well as how many staff members to schedule. If underestimated the number of customers, restaurants would run into shortages and customers would be unhappy. If overestimated, restaurant would have borne unnecessary costs. However, This forecast isn't easy to make because many unpredictable factors affect restaurant attendance, such as weather and local competition. It's even harder for newer restaurants with little historical data.
